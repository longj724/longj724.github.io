      <description>This is of the main projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on while learning Javascript. It has served as a good platform for me to practice implementing different features that are common in web apps. It is only hosted locally using Express, but &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; can sign in with their email and create a virtual book shelf that tracks books they have read and books they want to read. I used the Google Books API to allow users to search for books and retrieve information about them.</description>
